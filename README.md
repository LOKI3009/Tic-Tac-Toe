Tic Tac Toe is a simple 3×3 grid game played between two players.
One player uses X, the other uses O.

How to Play:
1. Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) in an empty cell.
2. The goal is to get three in a row – either:
Horizontally (---),
Vertically ( | ), or
Diagonally ( \ or / ).
3. If all 9 cells are filled and no one has 3 in a row → it’s a Draw.
Example Board:
X | O | X

O | X | O

O | X | -
